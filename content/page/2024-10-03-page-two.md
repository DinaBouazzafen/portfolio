My goal in creating this infographic was to visually represent the evolution of Marvel's characters alongside societal changes. The challenge was to condense decades of storytelling into an engaging and accessible format. Inspired by Ines Cox’s innovative design style, I used experimental typography, color, and composition to capture the dynamic nature of Marvel's universe. 

The infographic guides viewers through different eras, with each section reflecting the mood and themes of the time. Special attention was given to the portrayal of female characters, using visuals to highlight their transformation from supporting roles to central figures. This evolution reflects not only changes in the comics but also shifting societal views on gender. The infographic informs and encourages reflection on the broader cultural significance of these characters.
